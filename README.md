# lockable_tree
A small personal Python project for learning python graphics

Idea is to have a tree made of nodes. A node can be locked if:
  * None of the nodes ancestors are locked
  * None of the nodes descendants are locked

Requirements:
  * Download [graphics.py](https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py) and add to src directory

To run:
  * python main.py
